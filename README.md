# Advent of Code 2021

Advent of Code is a programming event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). After bumping
into one of [TJ DeVries](https://www.youtube.com/c/TJDeVries)'s videos where [he tackles the
AoC's challenges in Rust](https://youtu.be/G3JDYAiX5PU), I felt inspired to try and do the same
thing.

As I opened the Day 1 description page, I realized a sign-up was required. I used my GitHub
account as the authentication provider and was given a code as proof of my registration.
